        and technology interact improving their daily experiences. I'm such an inquisitive and friendly
        person that wants to help people by collecting ideas from everything around me, understanding
        their culture, pain points, happiness, and traditions wherever I am. My
        daily work includes empathy, strategy, logic, strategy, and common sense
        and willingness to help people get their goals. I have a background in
