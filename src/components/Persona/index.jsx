        technology and human behaviours. I like to design the way people and technology
        interact improving their daily experiences. I'm such a inquisitive and
        friendly person that wants to help people by collecting ideas from
        everything around me, understanding their culture, pain points,
        happiness and traditions wherever I am. My daily work includes empathy,
        strategy, logic, strategy, and common sense and willness to help people get their goals.
        I have a background in software engineering but I've been actively seeking new roles in my life.
